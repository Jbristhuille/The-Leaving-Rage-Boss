## Game plot

The boss has had enough

As he heard the steps of all the adventurers rushing into his castle, full of greed and relentless in their assaults, the Lord of darkness just had enough.
He had used most of his remaining treasury from all the raids he suffered to buy a locating spell and finally found the source of these attacks.
A simple man behind a screen in another dimension, controlling all these so called « heroes ».
Today he would put an end to this, today he would have his revenge !
But first he must pass through his castle, past the heroes already coming for him and through the portal that has been making them appear in his world.
Wil you help him in his journey ?
